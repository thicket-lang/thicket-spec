= Thicket Language Specification

== Introduction

Thicket is a general-purpose statically and strongly typed programming language. It supports object-oriented and
functional programming styles. Its object-oriented system is based on model and trait multiple inheritance.

The Thicket type system is based on nominal subtyping with subtyping polymorphism. A static typing means that every 
expression has a known compile-time type and language guarantees that at runtime it will evaluate to an instance of 
that type. Such strong typing means any conversions between different type are explicit or expressed using adapter 
mechanism which are User-defined implicit conversions instanciable during the compilation stage.

Thicket syntax is intended to be simple and coherent. It supports traditional nested block expression with most of 
control structure express using the language and its lazyness capabiliy. For instance switch, when/then/else, sequence
and for/while structures are in fact libraries expressed in Thicket.

Last but not least *null* does not exist in the language since side effect does not exists in the language. Immutability 
is a strong principle like in any traditional pure functional languages. Then data evolution is a basic principle and
this is done using object and class mutation instruction available in the language.

== General
Thicket is a functionnal programming language with prototype, trait and class definitions. 

=== First Contact

----
$ thicket toplevel                       <1>
Thicket v0.1
> console.log "Hello, World!"            <2>
Hello, World!                            <3>
 - : Console = <model Console>           <4>                            
----
<1> Start Thicket REPL using Core package
<2> Display "Hello, World!" using the builtin console
<3> String displayed in the standard output
<4> Returned value which is the console itself

=== Playing with the language

==== Playing with primitives

Some _primitive_ data like `number`, `string` and `char` are available in the language.

----
> 1
- : number = 1
----

----
> "Hello"
- : string = "Hello"
----

----
> 'a'
- : char = 'a'
----

==== Playing with functions

----
> def apply = f x -> { f x }                <1>
> apply
- : ['a,'b]('a -> 'b) -> 'b = <function>
> apply (1+) 2                            <2> <3>
- : number = 3
----
<1> A function can be defined without explicit type.
<2> The type checker synthetized and validate data type usage.
<3> `(i \-> 1+i)` is equivalent to `(1+)` i.e. http://www.lambda-bound.com/book/lambdacalc/node21.html[&eta;-reduction]

==== Playing with models

A model is a named structure where each declared attributed is public. 

----
> model Point { x:number y:number }         <1>
> Point                                     <2>
- : number -> number -> Point
> Point 0 1                                 <3>
- : Point = <model Point>
> Point 0 1 x
- : number = 0                              <4>
----
<1> A `Point` can be defined with a cartesian position i.e `x` and `y`.
<2> This definition creates a public constructor which is a function.
<3> Such function has parameters determined by the attributes declaration
order.
<4> Each attribute is public and can be accessed using its name.

==== Playing with classes

A class provides behaviors for a given denoted data type. Such denoted
data his by default hidden and can not be accessed by default. 

----
> class point this:Point {                  <1>
    moveX : number -> point                 <2>
} {
    def moveX dx = 
        point new this with x=(this.x+dx)   <3>
}
> point
- : Point -> point                          
> point $ Point 0 1                         <4>
- : point = <class point>
> point (Point 0 1) moveX                   <5>
- : number -> point = <function>
> point::moveX                              <6>
- : point -> number -> point
----
<1> A class `point` is defined for any `Point` denoted by `this` in each behaviors.
<2> This class provides a `moveX` capability returning a point.
<3> Moving a `point` creates a new one since mutability is not a primitive capability.
<4> A `point` is then a function creating an instance with a given `Point`.
<5> Moving a point can be done using a partial function
<6> A method reference can also be used. Then `p moveX 1` is same as `point::moveX p 1`.

The symbol `$` is used for any new terminal application block. Then `f (g (x y))` is similar to `f $ g $ x y`.

== The Thicket Syntax

The Thicket language syntax is inspired by functional languages and object oriented languages. From this starting point we propose now a step by step language description and specification.

=== Lexical conventions 

==== Blanks

The following characters are considered as blanks: space, newline, horizontal tabulation, carriage return, line feed and form feed. These characters as no specific signification and are ignored. 

==== Comments

Comments are introduced by two conventions inspired by the Java(TM) and C languages. First one is a line based comment when the second is a block based comment.

----
comment ::= // (char - {\n})* \n? 
            /* char* - {*/} */
----

There is no way to specify structural comment like Java andits corresponding mechanism called javadoc. The current version of the syntax does not provide any support for documentation construction for API definition and navigation. Encapsulated block commment in another one is not allowed. In that case a comment like `/\*1 ... /*2 ... 2*/ ...1*/` starts at token `/*1` and ends at `2*/`. Therefore all characters following this comment are considered as a Thicket source code fragment.

==== Integer literals

An Integer is a sequence of one or more digit. A negative number is specified with the minus sign at the beginning of the literal. Default supported integers are in decimal (radix 10). An alternative syntax is proposed for hexadecimal (radix 16) integer definition; these integers are preceded by the 0x prefix or 0X prefix.

----
number ::= [+-]?[0-9]+(.[0-9]+)?((E|e)[+-]?[0-9]+)?
           [+-]?(0(x|X))([0-9]|[a-f]|[A-F])+
----

*Examples* `123`, `+1`, `-9`, `1.3e23`, `0xFF3E`, `+0XA3`, `-0xFE`, `-0Xab`

==== Character literals

A character literal is a single character delimited by the single quote character. A character literal can be a regular character or an escaped one.

----
character ::= 'char - {’}’
char      ::= (regular|escaped) escaped ::= \(b|r|n|t|f|’|")
----

The syntax prohibits the `’’’` sequence because it’s interpreted as `(’’)’`. Then the character literal does not enclose any character and the last quote has not corresponding ending quote which implies an unbalanced term. For this purpose escaped characters are defined then the right syntax for the previous character literal is ’ ́’. Indeed some characters can also be denoted usign this escape sequence as usual in a programming language.

*Examples*: `’a’`, `’\t’`, `’\’’`
  
==== String literals

A string is a sequence of characters delimited by double quote character.

----
string ::= "(char - {"})*"
----

The syntax prohibits the `"""` sequence because it’s interpreted as `("")"`. The empty string is valid but the last double quote don’t imply a well balanced term and then it’s not a well formed sequence of literals.

*Examples*: `"a simple string"`, `"Another \"one\""`, `"A multi \n line string"`

==== Identifier and Operators

Identifiers are used when specifying any kind of entity or variable in the language.

----
identifier ::= [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_$]*('?)
operator   ::= ([~$#?;:@&!%><=+*/|.^-]|\\|\[|\])([~$#?;:@&!%><=+*/|_.^-]|\\|\[|\])*
